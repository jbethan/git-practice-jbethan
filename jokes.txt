Every Lab 2 could be spruced up with a few jokes. Unfortunately I'm out of jokes so this is what the internet has to offer.

"What do you call a pile of cats? A meow-ntain"

"Why did the bicycle fall over? Because it was two tired"

"I ordered a chicken and an egg online. Iâ€™ll let you know what comes first."
